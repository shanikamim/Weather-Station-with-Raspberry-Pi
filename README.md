# Weather-Station-with-Raspberry-Pi
This work Shows a development model of a low cost weather station using free hardware & software, connected to the internet, giving real time data taken from the station, as well as history of the stored data. 
This weather station will give information about air humidity, temparature, gas and  raining.
I am using here Raspberry pi, DHT22 sensor, rain sensor & gas sensor.
